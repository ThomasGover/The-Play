# The-Play
# Act I
## Scene i


We open on a bright spring morning at West Point. The sun shines on the cadets below:

**Sun:** Hey! Watch where you're going! I'm shining here! I'm shining here!

**Cadet X:** Anyone notice the sun giving off Taxi Driver vibes? No? Just me? Ok cool.

**Cadet Y:** Hey shut up man, here's the WPR answers I promised you. Keep them secret. Keep them safe.

The cadets keep walking under the sun. Cadet X trying his best to hide the illicit materials. Eventually, they both run into COL Iam Theprof.

**COL Theprof:** You're a wizard, Harry!

**Cadet X:** What did you say, sir?

**COL Theprof:** Oh, sorry, got carried away. Good morning, Cadet X!

They salute

**Cadet X:** Did you hear that, Cadet Y? COL Theprof says I am a wizard!

**Cadet Y:** Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.

**Cadet X:** :(

**Sun:** Real clever, Cadet Y! You'll be gone with wind after I'm done shining on you! I'm shining here!

**Cadet Y:** Wow! The sun is bright!

**COL:** What do you have there, Cadet X? It looks like a WPR.

**Cadet X:** I was just studying sir. I have a big test coming up.

**COL:** Oh wonderful! I do love me a good test! May I see your study materials?

**Cadet X:** Uhh.... Umm... You see.. well.... These are not the droids you're looking for.

COL Theprof looks confused.

**COL Theprof:** Fair enough.

Exit **COL Theprof**
