# The-Play

We open on a bright spring morning at West Point. The sun shines on the cadets below:

**Sun:** Hey! Watch where you're going! I'm shining here! I'm shining here!

**Cadet X:** Anyone notice the sun giving off Taxi Driver vibes? No? Just me? Ok cool.

**Cadet Y:** Hey shut up man, here's the WPR answers I promised you. Keep them secret. Keep them safe.

The cadets keep walking under the sun. Cadet X trying his best to hide the illicit materials. Eventually, they both run into COL Iam Theprof.

**COL Theprof:** You're a wizard, Harry!

**Cadet X:** What did you say, sir?

**COL Theprof:** Oh, sorry, got carried away. Good morning, Cadet X!

They salute
